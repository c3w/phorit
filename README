PHORIT v0.1

*roll your own system*

This is a 'dialog' based system rollout script, for things like ssh keys, crontabs, snmp configs, etc etc.

I KNOW there are config-based rollout packages out there, but as usual, I like to roll my own.

Usage is simple.  create a command in commands/, put your files in packages/ and run 'phor'

The 2nd line of your command should look like #.# oneworddescription
This is passed into dialog so you know what command you're about to run.

PHOR uses your local /etc/hosts to derive a list of hosts to roll to - check off each one you want, and blammo.

I've included some sample commands/packages, including sshkeys, which you generally want to run first so you have
password-less access to roll out the rest of your packages.

I've been using this for about two(2) years, and decided it was time to share.

It will iterate multiple checkboxed commands over multiple checkboxed hosts!

If you're afraid to run this as root, command out the root check in the primary phor script.

Now Go PHOR IT!  It's PHOR I.T.

Chas.
